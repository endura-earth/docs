| Strategic Oversight      | Strategic oversight relates to the business function that will assist in tracking progress and setting strategies regarding climate risk and opportunities. The oversight body will not manage the subject matter, but rather oversee the functionality thereof. |
| Greenhouse Gases (GHG)   | Greenhouse gases (GHGs) as gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. The primary GHGs covered by the GHG Protocol include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons.                                    |
| Greenhouse Effect        | The greenhouse effect is the process by which greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in global temperatures and contributing to climate change.                                                                            |

| Transition Risk          | Transition risks are a specific category of climate risk facing the business community. Transition risks result from the relative uncertainty created by the global shift towards a more sustainable, net-zero economy.                                          |
| Physical Risk            | Physical risks, such as extreme weather events and natural disasters, can disrupt supply chains, damage assets and infrastructure, and lead to increased operational costs for regular businesses.                                                               |
| Acute Physical Risks     | Acute physical risks are defined as those that arise from short-term, extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes, floods, and heatwaves. These risks can cause immediate and severe impacts on assets, operations, and supply chains.                   |
| Chronic Physical Risks   | Chronic physical risks as those that arise from long-term changes in climate patterns, such as sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and changes in precipitation patterns.                                                                             |
| Scope 1 emissions        | Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas emissions that occur from sources that are owned or controlled by the company, such as company-owned vehicles and onsite fuel combustion.                                                                            |
