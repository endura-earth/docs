# Risk Classification

## Approach

The E\&S risk level and material ESG issues are identified based on the industry code capturing the company's economic activity.

## Source

The function is based on two public sources which are both comprehensive, publicly available and developed by reputable institutions.

1. **E\&S risk: EBRD Environmental & Social Risk Categorisation List**

This list provides an E\&S risk level for 615 different NACE industry codes.

- Business activities are ranked according to EU statistical classification codes.

**For each NACE code, the list provides risks levels of three different categories:**

- Overall, it reflects a balanced assessment of:
  - Combined environmental and social risks associated with the industry concerned.

**For each category, the list provides three possible risk levels:**

- High:
  - The company's business activities may give risk to significant or long-term environmental and social risks and impacts.
  - These require specialised risk assessment, and the customer may not have the technical or financial means to manage them.
- Medium:
  - The company's business activities have limited environmental and social risks and impacts.
  - These are capable of being readily prevented or mitigated through technically and financially feasible measures.
- Low:
  - The company's business activities have minor/few environmental impacts associated with them.

2. **Material issues: SASB Materiality Finder**

Materiality map reveals how 26 sustainability issues manifest across 77 industries based on the SASB standards.

- SASB Standards identify those sustainability issues that are financially material to an industry.
- Material to understanding how a company creates enterprise value.
- These standards encompass environmental and social information as well as operational governance.

The SARB Standards:

- Environment:
  - GHG emissions, air quality, energy management, water & waste management, waste & hazardous material management and ecological impacts
- Social capital:
  - Human rights & community, relations, customer privacy, data security, access & affordability, product quality and safety, customer welfare, selling practices & product labelling
- Human capital:
  - Labor practices, employee health & safety, employee engagement, diversity & inclusion
- Leadership & governance:
  - Business ethics, competitive behavior, management of legal & regulatory environment, critical incident risk management and systemic risk management.

## Output

Upon selecting the industry code, the tool will present:

- Environmental risk level + social risk level + overall E\&S risk level
- Material environmental issues + Social issues
