title: Climate Risk
---

## Purpose:

- This classification provides a company with an indication of the transition and physical risks inherent to their operations. This informs the expected level of risk mitigation and adaptation efforts that needed to manage such risks.

## Transition Risk:

### Approach:

- Used sectoral GHG intensities (total annual GHG emissions in a sector divided by total annual output in that sector) as a proxy for a company's emissions exposure.

### Source:

- Emissions intensities modelled from the Global Trade Analysis Database (GTAP)
- Adjustments are made for critical sectors from the FirstRand TCFD report where necessary.

### Output:

- The tool will present GHG emissions for different scopes and a final emissions exposure score.

## Physical Risk:

### Approach:

- Look at location of company (or that of its major assets) and whether the company is active in a critical sector.

For both, we assign high-level risks to those sectors that are identified as climate-sensitive by the FirstRand Group.

### Source

- Hazard-specific risk levels from ThinkHazard.
- Key sectors/economic activities exposred to physical climate risk from the World Bank Climate Risk Country profiles.

### Output:

- After selecting the municipality/province of offices/major assests, the tool returns rik levels for 9 hazards and a single score. For both, we assign high-level risks to those sectors that are identified as climate-sensitive by the FirstRand Group.
