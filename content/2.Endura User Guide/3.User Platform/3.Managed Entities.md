Title: Managed Entities
---

The Entities page in Endura provides an interface for managing and viewing entities within the platform. It allows users to search, filter, and interact with their related entities based on their roles, industry, and type. This page is divided into two main sections: **Managed entities** and **Entity portfolio**.

### **Features**

- **Search Bar:** To search for a specific entity, simply enter the entity’s name or relevant keyword into the search bar. The list will update automatically to display matching results.
- **Filters:** Utilize the filters for Role, Industry, and Entity Type to narrow down the list of entities displayed. This is particularly useful when managing a large number of entities.
- **Viewing Entity Details:** Click on an entity’s name in the list to view more detailed information related to that entity.
- **Create Entity Button:** Located on the right side, this button allows users to create a new entity. Upon clicking, you will be guided through a series of steps to set up the entity with necessary details such as general information, industry, location, size, and any specific modules or legal consents required.
- **Find Entity Button:** The Find Entity button, located next to the "Create Entity" button, is used to search for and connect with organizations.

### **Managed Entities**

- This is the default tab where you can see the entities you have direct management access to. It lists entities with their Name, Score, Platform Users, Status, and Role.
- **Name:** The name of the entity.
- **Score:** The entity’s performance or evaluation score.
- **Platform Users:** Number of users associated with the entity.
- **Status:** The current status of the entity, such as access or pending access.
- **Role:** Their specific role or access level.
