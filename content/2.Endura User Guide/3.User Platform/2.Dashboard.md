The Invite Partner screen allows you to invite partners or suppliers to collaborate within the Endura platform. Here's how to complete the invitation process:

**Steps to Invite a Partner or Supplier:**

1. **Enter the Partner's Email Address:** In the Email field, type the email address of the partner or supplier you want to invite.
2. **Compose a Message (Optional):** Use the Message box to add a personalized note or instructions for the recipient. This field is optional but recommended for clarity.
3. **Select the Type of Entity:** From the Type of entity you are inviting dropdown, select the appropriate entity type (e.g., Supplier, Partner, etc.).
4. **Enter the Entity Name:** In the Entity name field, provide the name of the partner's or supplier's entity.
5. **Configure ESG Modules:** Under the Module name section, toggle the switches for the ESG modules you wish to enable for this partner or supplier (e.g., Climate, Environmental & Social, Labour).For each module, you can also set the Maturity level (e.g., Starter, Intermediate, Advanced) and the Validation option (e.g., Endura, External).
6. **Invite Partner:** Once all the information is filled in, click the Invite Partner button at the bottom right of the screen to send the invitation. If you wish to cancel the process, click the Cancel button.

**Notes:**

- The partner or supplier will receive an invitation email with the details youâ€™ve entered, along with instructions on how to join the platform.
- The modules and validation options selected during this process will determine the level of access and the specific data your partner or supplier can interact with.

This functionality allows you to easily onboard and collaborate with external entities, ensuring that all necessary ESG data and processes are managed effectively within the platform.
