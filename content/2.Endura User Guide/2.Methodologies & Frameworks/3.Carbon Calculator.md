## Methodology:

The carbon calculator takes the company activity (ie. electricity consumed) and multiplies it by the emissions factor.

| 1   | Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE)   | The DFFE publishes a national GHG inventory report from which emission factors can be manually estimated.                   |
| 2   | UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)    | The DEFRA GHG conversion factors are suitable for international use and can be applied in SA when local data is unavailable.|
| 3   | U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)                     | The EPA GHG emissions factors are suitable in SA.                                                                           |
